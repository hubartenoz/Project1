Face designs for three characters that need bringing to their proper age. 

1. Mira Addroc - She needs to be about late 30's early 40's. She is a military woman and a commanding officer. 
I wouldn't be against giving her a good scar and she needs to be showing the first real sign of aging. For feel
this is the closest character to it's final look. She really only needs the aging treatment and she is ready to go. She can't appear too old to be an active soldier though. 

2. Micheal Kalder - Father of the main protagonist. Needs to be about mid to late 40's This character least resembles how I want the finished product to appear. And a very likeley outside commission. I want him to have a low tech steampunk-ish mechanical eye. And his hair a much darker navy blue streaked with white. Ideally I want a salt and pepper look for that guy. I would also like his beard to move with his facial expressions. Right now it looks as though someone stuck it to his face lol. He is a taciturn methodical scholar. As well as a seasoned combatant. He does not readily display his emotions. Which makes his crying face ridunkulous for him. 

3. Rhillia Kalder. Her clothes and her age are about the only thing that needs to change. She needs more civilian clothes. As well as being brought up to her real age of mid to late 40's. She is open and outgoing. And is definiteley where victor get's his troublemaking nature from. She is one of those people that decided to try and be more responsible when she became a parent. But sometimes her real nature just shines through. She's tough exhuberant and mischevious.
